I'm a data scientist and clinical psychologist trying to leverage my positive impact in the world. I enjoy [making music](https://soundcloud.com/oskerwyld/sets/ii_album), hiking, [photography](https://instagram.com/oskerwyld), weightlifting, [programming](https://github.com/welpo), stargazing, and reading.
