## Future Goals

## Development Practices

-   **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)**: Commit messages follow standardised formats to enhance readability.

## Project Evolution

**SafeMeds** was originally conceived at Duke University's premier hackathon, [HackDuke](https://2022.hackduke.org/). Despite its origins for personal use, best practices were implemented from the outset to ensure quality and maintainability. The site has since grown to accomodate tracking more drugs to meet user needs!
